MSc Thesis: "The Effect of Franchising on the Competitive Balance in eSports"

This project holds my code for my MSc Thesis in Economics. I originally coded it in Stata and have replicated my code in R, except for the robustness checks. I have excluded some parts of the data cleanign process, such as deletion of observations to set up the panel and other duplicates, which I had to do manually.

In my thesis I have created a new dataset from two different sources, namely [lol.fandom](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Help:Leaguepedia_API) and [elixers](https://oracleselixir.com/stats/players/byTournament). Using player level data I analysed how the change in the league format from a non-franchised system with relegation and promotion to a franchised system without relegation and promotion of the biggest eSports game "League of Legends" effected:

* item1 The probability of competing
* item2 Whether this shift in the probability of competing comes from
item 2 Whether this shift in the probability of competing comes from
    Sub Item 2 New players entering
    b) Existing players leaving
3) The competitive Balance

Abstract:

I find that that the probability of competing for players has diminished significantly. The reason for this is that the change in the league format made it more likely for new players to enter into the competition. This suggests that the overall level of play has increased as bad players are being wedged out and
only the high performing players remain. Lastly, using the standard deviation of wins, a common competitive balance estimator, I find that the competitive balance has decreased after the treatment. Since there is an increase in new player talent, the distortion in the competitive balance implies that the already successful teams are investing more into new talent compared to unsuccessful teams.
